# Bioinformatics Toolbox (`biotool`)

C++ API of basic methods from sequential and structural bioinformatics.

## Introduction

When building software for bioinformatics, it may be useful to focus only
on UI and let somebody else implement the methods and algorithms that
deal with your data.
`biotool` C++ API provides exactly such service, although only basic
bioinformatics methods are available at the moment.

`biotool` focuses on both sequential and structural bioinformatics
methods, which can be divided into four main areas:

* FASTA file parsing,
* PDB file parsing and structural analysis,
* Sequence pair analysis,
* Clustal parsing and MSA analysis.

## Installation and requirements

Read [programmer's documentation](docs/development) to get informed about
what is required to use `biotool` C++ API in your project.

## API

Read [API documentation](docs/api) to get informed about how to use
`biotool` C++ API in your project.

## License

Read [LICENCE](LICENSE) to get informed about licensing, distribution and
allowed usage of `biotool`.
